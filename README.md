# Exoplanet Exploration Through Data Mining
 Human interest in space exploration often takes root at a young age, when many children say they want to be astronauts when they grow up. At least, until they see Ridley Scott’s *Alien* (1986) and decide maybe it’s better to not. The inspiration for this project comes from a similarly rooted childhood wonder towards the stars, further fuelled by BioWare’s Mass Effect series.
The dataset being analyzed is a collection of planetary systems, detailing exoplanets and their stellar hosts, as well as their associated recordable properties, collected and hosted by NASA and Caltech on The NASA Exoplanet Archive. This particular dataset has 38,090 entries across 92 columns covering the planets’ mass relative to Earth and Jupiter, Insolation Flux, the Orbital Periods, among other properties. The archive also hosts a corresponding data dictionary which provides more detail to the data of each column. As such, there should be sufficient data to establish some patterns through mining and subsequent modelling.
